  <h1>FCC Website 2.0</h1>

  <p>
    While the strategy is being developed, the FCC is featuring a temporary project website 
    that can share the ongoing work. However, work is underway to prepare the next version 
    of this website. This report highlights some of this work.
  </p>

  <h2>Rationale</h2>

  <p>
    There are two key reasons why we are setting up a different website. Firstly, we believe
    that an interactive website that comes with some useful tools that are specific to 
    restoration of fynbos in Cape Town can really benefit other organisations and groups
    that are wanting to do similar work. The current website is set up primarily as an informational
    website and we need some structural changes to embed more advanced tools. Secondly, 
    the current website of Communitree features a number of tools around mapping, tracking 
    of species origin, nursery management, and other tools that would be useful to share 
    with FCC. Communitree has decided to work on integration of these tools in the FCC 
    website, and to donate the required programming work in order to do so. In order to take
    full advantage of these various tools and increased capacity we are therefore 
    developing a new platform for FCC, to be launched some time in 2021.
  </p>

  <h2>Technology</h2>

  <p>The following technologies are used to develop the website. All of these technologies
  are open source:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Django 3</li>
    <li>Python 3</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>PostGIS</li>
    <li>Docker</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Licensing</h2>

  <p>
    The new FCC platform will be made available as open source software, allowing other parties 
    to freely use the source code, and making it easier for other people to contribute to this
    project as well. All code will be published under an MIT license (see:
    https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Code will be made available through the open source
    repository of Github.
