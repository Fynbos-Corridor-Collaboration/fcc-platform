  <h1>High-impact strategic river corridors</h1>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>

  <p>
    This document describes how we identified potential corridors that 
    we believe can yield high social and environmental impacts. The 
    following general concepts lie behind these corridors:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      A river or canal forms the backbone of the potential corridors.  By
      following a river, there is an opportunity to use an existing ecological
      corridor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rivers were chosen that have poor water quality. These rivers are often a
      liability in social and environmental terms. By working on restoring the
      vegetation around the river, the actual river receives attention and 
      this rehabilitation project can have additional environmental and social impacts.
    </li>
    <li>
      The selected areas are currently <em>not</em> close to high-quality nature, based on the 
      Bionet network. By working on gardens in this area, there is an opportunity 
      to reduce the distance to nature for people living here.
    </li>
    <li>
      We prioritised areas that are either generally less affluent (and where fynbos rehabilitation
      is often most needed), or where the rivers
      cross both affluent and low-income areas and where there is thus an opportunity
      to cross these socio-economic divides and roll out a project where people
      work together across these boundaries.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The maps below demonstrate the steps that were taken to identify the
    high-impact strategic river corridors. We welcome your input and we hope to further
    refine this project by receiving feedback. If you have any suggestions or comments,
    please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Poor quality rivers</h2>

  <p>
    In order to assess which rivers have poor water quality - and are thus most in need
    of our attention - we relied on information from a great river study published
    by the City of Cape Town: <a href="https://resource.capetown.gov.za/documentcentre/Documents/City%20research%20reports%20and%20review/Inland_Water_Quality_Report_FULL.pdf">Water quality of rivers and open waterbodies in the City of Cape Town: Status and historical trends, with a focus on the period April 2015 to March 2020</a>. An important quote from this
    document is the following:
  </p>

  <p>
  <em>
  The quality of water in urban watercourses is perhaps one of the best
  indicators of the efficacy of a range of management activities in a city,
  reflecting the degree of containment of sources of contamination from both
  widespread land use and specific activities generating point source  pollution
  streams.  The implications of poor  water  quality  can  also  be  profound,
  cutting  across  a  broad  range  of  user  sectors,  including  human health,
  sewer and stormwater infrastructure, tourism, recreation and biodiversity.</em> (p3)
  </p>

  <p>
    We have taken these ideas to heart and therefore start with the selection 
    of priority areas by looking at river quality data. For this purpose, we primarily 
    used figure 4.7.3 which included E.coli levels per subcatchment area (which 
    generally encompasses individual rivers). We did not find a general river
    quality indicator, but felt that the E.coli levels are a suitable alternative
    for now. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <img src="/media/corridors/ecoli.png" alt="" />
    <br>
    <em><small>Comparison of current (April 2019 to March 2020) E. coli data with data from the previous 4 year
    record per subcatchment, plotted against the thresholds for different levels of risk.
    </small></em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The next step for us was to identify these rivers in our 
    <a href="/maps/983382/">Open Water Courses</a> shapefile. In this shapefile
    rivers are sometimes split up in several segments, so we did our best to pick
    up all the relevant segments. The list below shows the identified rivers:
  </p>

  <ul>
  {% for each in rivers %}
    <li><a href="{{ each.get_absolute_url }}">{{ each }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <p>
    In the list above, we noticed that the Lotus Canal was missing. However, from experience
    working along this canal, we feel that the Lotus Canal should also be included. It is not 
    of a high quality and has a lot of potential. We therefore added it to the list.
  </p>

  <p>The map below shows the baseline for our low-quality river network.</p>

  <div id="river_map" class="map"></div>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Adding a buffer</h2>

  <p>
    In order to find suitable areas, we added a 400m buffer on both sides of each river. 
    We consider this is suitable distance, as it will generally be within an 
    easy walking distance for most people, and it is furthermore a distance that
    most birds and insects can cross - especially if you find multiple stepping 
    stone gardens within this bandwidth.
  </p>

  <p>The resulting map is displayed below:</p>

  <div id="river_buffermap" class="map"></div>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Bionet</h2>

  <p>
    The next step was to pull up the Bionet map. This gives us insight into the 
    accessibility of nature in different areas of the city. The 
    <a href="/maps/983134/">original shapefile</a>
    is shown below.
  </p>

  <div id="bionet_flatmap" class="map"></div>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Buffering Bionet</h2>

  <p>
    We are wanting to <em>exclude</em> areas that already have access to high-quality
    nature by using the Bionet map. However, in order to do that we need to figure 
    out who lives close to these areas within the shapefile. We do that by again
    buffering the outline, and we add 400 meters around the bionet network. 
    The result can be seen below.
  </p>

  <div id="bionet_buffermap" class="map"></div>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Overlaying the rivers onto that map</h2>
  <p>We can now start combining the two maps. Here we show what the buffered Bionet
  and the buffered river network look like...</p>
  <div id="overlaymap" class="map"></div>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Cropping the river network</h2>
  <p>
    The last step is to crop the river network, and remove those segments
    that are already covered by Bionet. This results in the map that is displayed
    below.
  </p>
  <div id="map" class="map"></div>

  <p>
    Based on this map, we then identified five different river segments that we
    consider the most strategic elements. We excluded the northern river
    system from the list because this is much less urbanised than the other
    river catchment areas. There might very well be a lot of value in focusing
    on the northern part, where agricultural impacts certainly threaten
    Fynbos just as urbanisation does in the south. However, our initial focus 
    is on stepping-stone corridor creation in an urban setting, and we thus
    focused on the other river systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of the remaining six larger river systems that are identified, we eliminated
    the eastern-most river. This too is in a much less urbanised area than 
    the other rivers, and it is for that reason less interesting as a starting
    point from our perspective. What remains are the five corridors that 
    are listed on our <a href="/corridors/rivers/">overview page</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Room for improvement</h2>

  <p>
    We don't consider this a final verdict, but instead hope for this map to 
    start a more in-depth conversation. There are already a few elements which
    we hope to refine as more data and information become available. These include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Instead of basing the river quality on E.coli measurements, we hope that a
      more general river quality assessment might help us to better pinpoint the 
      rivers to target. Ideally that includes a longer list of rivers than the ones
      currently reported.
    </li>
    <li>
      The vleis and other open water bodies such as wetlands are also very interesting
      to take into account. However, we still need to cross-link the data from 
      the Cape Town study with the shapefiles that we have. Any help here is 
      most welcome.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are aware that taking Bionet as a basic layer to identify access to nature
      might not be the most accurate assessment. There might be potential or future
      natural elements in Bionet which are not actually representative of 'access to 
      high-quality nature'. We might need to refine this. 
    </li>
    <li>
      When the green infrastructure plan from the city is released, we might be able
      to use some of their insights to further improve our mapping.
    </li>
  </ul>
